  <text start="36.09" dur="9.78">thank you have you ever thought about</text>
  <text start="43.239" dur="5.75">starting to play the piano as an adult</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="5.259">then guess what you&amp;#39;re not the only one</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="2.92">whenever I meet new people and we start</text>
  <text start="51.129" dur="3.301">the conversation</text>
  <text start="51.909" dur="4.83">I realized that almost everybody would</text>
  <text start="54.43" dur="5.519">love to play the piano it seems like</text>
  <text start="56.739" dur="5.221">it&amp;#39;s an everyone&amp;#39;s bucket list some of</text>
  <text start="59.949" dur="6.21">them tell me I would just wait until I</text>
  <text start="61.96" dur="5.88">get retired but then I was thought and</text>
  <text start="66.159" dur="5.25">some of them took lessons in the</text>
  <text start="67.84" dur="7.55">childhood but almost all of them quit in</text>
  <text start="71.409" dur="6.511">their teenage years and then I regret it</text>
  <text start="75.39" dur="4.75">they are still attached to the sound of</text>
  <text start="77.92" dur="3.12">the piano and they would like to start</text>
  <text start="80.14" dur="3.689">playing again</text>
  <text start="81.04" dur="5.82">but they know it would have to be in a</text>
  <text start="83.829" dur="5.07">somehow different way when I was a kid</text>
  <text start="86.86" dur="4.619">the first instrumental learned was the</text>
  <text start="88.899" dur="5.191">guitar I immediately fell in love with</text>
  <text start="91.479" dur="4.17">this instrument for me practicing was</text>
  <text start="94.09" dur="5.01">fun and that was very passionate about</text>
  <text start="95.649" dur="5.731">it it didn&amp;#39;t take long until I wanted to</text>
  <text start="99.1" dur="5.789">share my passion with artists so started</text>
  <text start="101.38" dur="6.72">teaching at about age 14 some years</text>
  <text start="104.889" dur="6.15">later I discovered the piano I was</text>
  <text start="108.1" dur="5.939">around 20 years old and never surprised</text>
  <text start="111.039" dur="5.881">by the fact that with only few technical</text>
  <text start="114.039" dur="6.33">abilities I was already able to play</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="6.96">something meaningful standing here now I</text>
  <text start="120.369" dur="7.711">have about 25 years 25 years of teaching</text>
  <text start="123.88" dur="7.74">experience mostly with adults before a</text>
  <text start="128.08" dur="6.15">full event online or digital with my</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="5.339">teaching I often gave one-on-one teaser</text>
  <text start="134.23" dur="5.339">lessons when people join me for the</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="7.261">first time I always asked one simple</text>
  <text start="139.569" dur="6.75">question what are you looking for and my</text>
  <text start="144.22" dur="3.599">potential students always reacted by</text>
  <text start="146.319" dur="4.471">giving me a surprising look and said</text>
  <text start="147.819" dur="6.121">well you&amp;#39;re the piano teacher so teach</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="5.73">me how to play but my main motive for</text>
  <text start="153.94" dur="3.89">asking was to find out what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.52" dur="4.7">really yearning for</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="6.67">then there were always three answers I</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="9.01">want to feel joy in my life playing the</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="8.76">piano has to be fun second I would have</text>
  <text start="170.23" dur="5.76">a relaxing experience I just want to sit</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="4.37">there after stressful day and have a</text>
  <text start="175.99" dur="5.67">good time</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="7.079">third I want to regain some of the</text>
  <text start="181.66" dur="5.4">creativity that is lacking in my life</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="4.451">so in conclusion they were all looking</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="3.89">for a space where they could encounter</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="6.09">these the points that I just mentioned</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="5.68">that&amp;#39;s what they really wanted then</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="3.9">there are also people who are already</text>
  <text start="196.63" dur="5.13">playing but they were somehow stuck in</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="6.3">the learning process I asked them to</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="8.01">play something and some of them played</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="9.33">so well that I thought holy cow what in</text>
  <text start="209.77" dur="8.76">the world can I teach them until I asked</text>
  <text start="214.78" dur="8.7">one simple question please play a</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="9.03">variation of what it is played hmm they</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="5.85">never stand it wasn&amp;#39;t possible and they</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="6.929">would often tell me exactly the same</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="8.46">story I&amp;#39;m puzzled I can play but I also</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="4.861">can&amp;#39;t I just feel like impressing some</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="3.99">keys on a keyboard instead of making</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="4.859">real music and I only know a certain</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="3.84">amount of pieces and for this I need</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="4.59">sheet music in front of me</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="5.55">I learned them by heart I mean everyone</text>
  <text start="248.799" dur="4.051">down practicing all my pieces as you</text>
  <text start="251.17" dur="4.53">start all over again with the first one</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="4.62">because I already forgot it this is</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="3.42">definitely not what I&amp;#39;m looking for I</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="6.38">would like to be able to play much more</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="7.08">freely and express my feelings hmm</text>
  <text start="263.85" dur="4.93">hearing this from all these people made</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="5.01">me realize the way I wanted to teach</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="5.28">piano was much more than just showing</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="5.28">them where to press which Keys making</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="6.05">music should enrich the lives on a much</text>
  <text start="276.49" dur="6.239">deeper level the big problem is that</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="6.79">expectations are often so different from</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="6.75">reality I realized that these goals that</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="4.81">is just mentioned before and traditional</text>
  <text start="289.479" dur="4.621">given methods simply don&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="5.85">there is no creativity involved and</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s always a clear right or wrong</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="5.93">and no freedom to move away from that</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="6.46">and they cannot express the feelings I</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="7.269">always wondered how we got here so did a</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="8.97">lot of research at this time I got a</text>
  <text start="310.759" dur="6.811">degree in organization management and</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="4.98">what I learned there had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="7.98">with music at all we learned how to</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="8.729">manage big huge complex projects we</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="7.619">divided complex things into manageable</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="9.661">pieces worked on them and put them</text>
  <text start="333.169" dur="6.261">together again hmm I thought that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="4.26">interesting</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="6.88">this led me to the idea that this must</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="6.299">also be possible for teaching music what</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="4.02">I found out during my research there are</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="5.461">basically two approaches to teaching</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="6.2">piano the first one is with sheet music</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="5.13">which is a very strict way of learning</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="5.919">and the second one is a quick-fix</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="5.49">tutorial a quick-fix tutorial to learn</text>
  <text start="362.449" dur="6.181">something as fast as possible</text>
  <text start="365" dur="6.949">as you can imagine YouTube is full of</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="6.029">these tutorials but neither of these two</text>
  <text start="371.949" dur="6.25">really suit the need for now adult</text>
  <text start="374.659" dur="8.19">learner because on both systems the</text>
  <text start="378.199" dur="8.161">context is missing context is the magic</text>
  <text start="382.849" dur="5.931">word it seemed to me there&amp;#39;s no actual</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="5.429">framework out there for teaching piano</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="7.419">so the question is what is the framework</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="7.801">a framework is a kind of a road map that</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="5.28">gives us direction all of us are used to</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="5.639">having frameworks in our daily lives a</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="6.601">framework is always a structure with</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="9.601">some free in a minute let me give you an</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="10.01">example all of us own a smartphone you</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="5.54">installed operating system</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.25">your installed operating system on your</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="6.72">smartphone is always given there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="6.03">structure you can change but the way we</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="5.4">are using our smartphones varies from</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="8.22">person to person it depends on the</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="7.89">individuals needs so I wanted to create</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="7.85">the framework with exactly the same</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="9.93">functionalities structure and creativity</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="6.43">and my requirements for this one rule it</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="6.99">should be easy for everyone to</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="10.31">understand second it should be possible</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="7.47">to adjust it on every skill level well</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="5.59">but these two things contradict each</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="6.78">other so there was a lot of thinking</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="7.56">going on and some more thinking and some</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="7.49">more and finally I came along with this</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="7.56">holistic method in one simple graphic in</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="6.55">this graphic all learning processes on</text>
  <text start="482.89" dur="5.18">the piano could be visualized it</text>
  <text start="485.59" dur="7.32">combines structure and creativity</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="7.15">equally let&amp;#39;s have a closer look to this</text>
  <text start="492.91" dur="4.95">graphic you see these three circles in</text>
  <text start="495.22" dur="7.71">the middle there I present the DNA of</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="7.8">music it&amp;#39;s always harmony melody and</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="5.85">written no matter what style of music</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="6.27">you like and the great thing about the</text>
  <text start="508.78" dur="5.639">piano is we can easily combine these</text>
  <text start="511.93" dur="5.88">three elements we don&amp;#39;t need another</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="6.081">instrument for it to sound great so let</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="2.69">me show you on the piano</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="7.26">and I&amp;#39;m talking about harmony I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="6.42">talking about two notes or more</text>
  <text start="532" dur="6.01">simultaneously they could be played with</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="6.59">the left hand with the right hand or</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="6.03">with both hands doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="4.6">maybe I&amp;#39;ve heard the expression quartz</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="4.919">that&amp;#39;s pretty much the same there are</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="12.71">many courts out there and sound like</text>
  <text start="548.959" dur="13.591">this okay so far so good</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="7.72">then let&amp;#39;s move to next element it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.55" dur="14.12">melody melody contains all the single</text>
  <text start="566.48" dur="13.77">notes very easy in the next element</text>
  <text start="576.67" dur="5.83">rhythm brings life in these two other</text>
  <text start="580.25" dur="3.899">elements but just what a play just</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="3.48">before at the beginning was the</text>
  <text start="584.149" dur="3.481">combination of these three elements</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="13.11">something like this</text>
  <text start="587.63" dur="11.46">[Music]</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="7.32">okay maybe I&amp;#39;ve heard some people</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="9.539">playing something like this</text>
  <text start="608.14" dur="8.87">[Music]</text>
  <text start="613.579" dur="5.711">and they always said same they are</text>
  <text start="617.01" dur="5.759">telling me I sound somehow cut off I</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="5.46">think I need to practice more but I</text>
  <text start="622.769" dur="3.931">wouldn&amp;#39;t do that I would practice</text>
  <text start="624.75" dur="5.97">differently that would just show you</text>
  <text start="626.7" dur="7.74">shortly what I figured out there are</text>
  <text start="630.72" dur="4.859">basically two main issues when it comes</text>
  <text start="634.44" dur="6.87">to learn to play the piano the</text>
  <text start="635.579" dur="10.141">traditional way first we only learn with</text>
  <text start="641.31" dur="7.85">our eyes we look at something and then</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="8.07">copy it no matter if it&amp;#39;s sheet music</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="8.41">it&amp;#39;s an app or a video tutorial we</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="6.299">always have this eye brain hands</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="4.79">connection which really slows down the</text>
  <text start="660.089" dur="6">learning process</text>
  <text start="662.36" dur="7.59">number two we try to combine these three</text>
  <text start="666.089" dur="7.44">elements harmony melody rhythm</text>
  <text start="669.95" dur="7.53">simultaneously but our mind can</text>
  <text start="673.529" dur="6.481">concentrate only on one thing at a time</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="5.169">so my solution how to start to play the</text>
  <text start="680.01" dur="4.73">piano would look like this instead of</text>
  <text start="682.649" dur="8.19">combining these three elements together</text>
  <text start="684.74" dur="10.18">we only focus on one element then we</text>
  <text start="690.839" dur="7.021">move from sense to sense builder on each</text>
  <text start="694.92" dur="7.38">little part on its own until gets really</text>
  <text start="697.86" dur="7.65">easy as soon something gets easy it will</text>
  <text start="702.3" dur="5.729">be internalized and as soon something is</text>
  <text start="705.51" dur="5.48">internalized they don&amp;#39;t have to think</text>
  <text start="708.029" dur="6.481">about it anymore it comes naturally</text>
  <text start="710.99" dur="6.13">tension in the piano the great thing</text>
  <text start="714.51" dur="5.639">about the piano is it&amp;#39;s very easy the</text>
  <text start="717.12" dur="5.13">only half black and white keys and they</text>
  <text start="720.149" dur="3.901">have a specific order and if you only</text>
  <text start="722.25" dur="4.199">understand just a small part a small</text>
  <text start="724.05" dur="5.219">part of the piano then we understand the</text>
  <text start="726.449" dur="8.211">whole keyboard because it repeats all</text>
  <text start="729.269" dur="5.391">the time so</text>
  <text start="735.11" dur="7.659">imagine first time on the piano I would</text>
  <text start="738.119" dur="6.45">recommend starting like this which is</text>
  <text start="742.769" dur="7.401">played in the right hand below the two</text>
  <text start="744.569" dur="10.49">Black Keys five knots</text>
  <text start="750.17" dur="11.32">each note for each key as its finger</text>
  <text start="755.059" dur="16.33">very easy then of course we could name</text>
  <text start="761.49" dur="12.569">these notes let&amp;#39;s see e f g and as I</text>
  <text start="771.389" dur="4.88">told you before we can also switch these</text>
  <text start="774.059" dur="7.22">notes above so if we have the same notes</text>
  <text start="776.269" dur="9.99">began it just repeats below</text>
  <text start="781.279" dur="15.151">exactly the same then an essential part</text>
  <text start="786.259" dur="13.56">to feeding music is hearing music as</text>
  <text start="796.43" dur="9.36">soon I start to hear these notes I have</text>
  <text start="799.819" dur="8.13">a much deeper connection to music then</text>
  <text start="805.79" dur="6.989">let&amp;#39;s move to the next element its</text>
  <text start="807.949" dur="7.44">harmony I just place my left hand in the</text>
  <text start="812.779" dur="7.17">same manner through these keys we have</text>
  <text start="815.389" dur="7.7">seen she played simultaneously remember</text>
  <text start="819.949" dur="5.911">harmony two or more notes simultaneously</text>
  <text start="823.089" dur="8.11">so that&amp;#39;s a basic chord but just to move</text>
  <text start="825.86" dur="10.579">this one a little bit up I have these</text>
  <text start="831.199" dur="8.361">two towards when I need them then to see</text>
  <text start="836.439" dur="7.811">now let&amp;#39;s combine these two elements</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="7.449">harmony and melody therefore I just play</text>
  <text start="844.25" dur="8.339">the same notes again above and to play</text>
  <text start="847.009" dur="7.05">the C chord and now in a play down some</text>
  <text start="852.589" dur="4.19">notes are in chime and some have a lot</text>
  <text start="854.059" dur="2.72">more tension</text>
  <text start="857.199" dur="6.45">and the magic starts when I changed your</text>
  <text start="860.739" dur="6.821">harmony then suddenly these notes here</text>
  <text start="863.649" dur="8.741">become another color listen to it</text>
  <text start="867.56" dur="8.91">[Music]</text>
  <text start="872.39" dur="5.12">I encourage my students to stay here for</text>

  <text start="900.89" dur="6.389">piece then you feel the pulse and most</text>
  <text start="904.79" dur="6.57">often they divide the pulse into four</text>
  <text start="907.279" dur="7.381">equal parts so we can count on for we</text>
  <text start="911.36" dur="4.169">just can clap a pause like this that can</text>

  <text start="924.61" dur="3.789">could play these two chorus that you</text>
